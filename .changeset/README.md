# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `npx changeset` in the root of this repository. You will be prompted to select
the type of version bump (major, minor, or patch) and to write a summary of the change.

The generated markdown file in this folder should be committed alongside your code changes.
